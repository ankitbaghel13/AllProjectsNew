Delhi, the Congress lampoons Modi's now famous hugs with several world leaders by describing them with droll epithets punctuated with reaction gifs.
Notable amongst these are PM Modi's "Titanic hug" with former French President Francois Hollande, the "Let me love you hug" which engulfed Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, and "That's enough hugs" with US President Donald Trump.
The video also dubs his interactions with female diplomats "awkward", as exhibited by cherry-picked footage showing his missed handshake with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and stilted courtesy to Japan's first lady Akie Abe.
Earlier today, PM Modi broke protocol to receive Israeli counterpart and "close friend" Benjamin Netanyahu on his maiden visit to India. No sooner had Netanyahu alighted from his flight, that Modi enveloped him in one of his trademark bear hugs. Israeli first lady Sara Netanyahu stood to one side watching as both leaders were locked in a prolonged embrace, interspersed with several pats on the back, which eventually concluded with a spirited double handshake.
